# Native POWER of Maid
This is a fork of the "TLM: True POWER" mod. It removes the dependency on the "True POWER" mod, enabling its integration into modpacks without compatibility issues with "True POWER." "TLM: True POWER" is a mod specifically designed to enhance a maid's ability to utilize SlashBlade for combat purposes. Full credit is attributed to the author of the original mod.


Minor Changes relative to original version:
1. Remove Void Slash (时空裂闪), which is implemented in the "True POWER" mod.
2. Remove a feature that the 【Judgement Cut (裂空审判)】or【Judgement Cut EX (裂空审判 EX)】 is required in all task to use SA (e.g., when play with Touhou Little Maid: Spell).
